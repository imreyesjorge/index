title: Starting a blog with Jekyll
---

> As we teach, we continue learning and growing

After some time away from bloggin, I wanted to get back to it. Writing is something I enjoy to do, and it's also something that let me learn and grow a lot. 

I've used external services such as [hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) that gave me the tools to start a personal blog, but now I wanted to build one myself, this way I have the control to use what I want, and to put in practice all the new things I keep learning. This time I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and host the site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the process was something fun to do.

Hope you'll join me in this journey and find something useful here aswell.

This was just a short post, to have something displayed here, see you on future posts.

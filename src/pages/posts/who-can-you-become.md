Modern life demands so much of our attention, from the chaotic movement that our cities sees every day, to our social media’s that overwhelm us with a toxic amount of, either bad things happening in our world, or the _good life_ that all are living but us.

Not surprises finding out that [social media may cause depression](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/social-media-use-increases-depression-and-loneliness), if almost everything we see there is curated material, our friends will not upload their _bad photos_, they select only the _best ones_. Can't you recall a moment when a friend arranged the table, just to take the best picture to share?

The point is, that we tend to compare ourselves, and seeing what someone else’s has accomplished can makes us feel left behind.

Please, stop comparing yourself with someone else, you don’t know how much time did have they spent working towards their ability. You might find yourselve feeling left behind because you haven’t get in 4 months, something that cost 4 years to others.

Also, don’t believe everything you see on social media, most of the people doesn’t have a perfect life, and we’re all struggling with something. **We just tend to share what we want others to see**.

## Your actual self doesn’t determine who can you become

Let’s say you are _bad_ at something. Well, this doesn’t determine neither your future ability or your life at all but somethings we tend to believe that we’re bad at something out of fear of trying or failing.

Don’t worry, failing isn’t a bad thing and it’s actually necessary to grow. Be afraid no more of starting your drawing journey, your psychology career, or anything that you desire, but be prepared to fail, and a lot. If you don’t start and practice, how can you become the person you wan’t to be?

> The thing is, **almost everyone that is _good_ at something, has a lot of practice behind**.

Sure, some are born with a special trait, but there’s still a path of practice to follow for them too. Life isn’t fair, and some people may find a harder time achieving their desired ability level, but **this doesn’t mean that they can’t achieve it**.

If you’re going to compare yourself, do it with your past self. You’ll be amazed of how much have you grown in a year. In fact I believe that, trying to be better than your yesterday’s version, will lead you to growth you never seen before.

What I want to say is that, despite the prognostic, whatever your goal is, pursue it. You’ll need to have patience and to practice a lot, but eventually it’s much likely that you can achieve your goal and this is a path worth trying.

Hope you realize that, you’re becoming the best version of yourself.

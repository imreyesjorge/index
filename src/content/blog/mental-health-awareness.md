This is my opinion and not medical advice. Your mental health is important and seeking help is not a sign of weakness. [Contact a healthcare professional if you need assistance](https://findahelpline.com/).

It's totally normal to feel all sorts of emotions, and you should never feel ashamed of any of them. We've all grown up in a world where it can be hard to know how to manage our feelings, but that's okay - nobody's perfect, and we're all just doing the best we can as human beings.

Know that you're not alone on this journey - we're all fighting our own battles, and sometimes it can be hard to see that, but we must be empathic with everyone else.

Lacking empathy towards someone can cause them to experience a sense of injustice and confusion, as they may question why they alone should suffer without any understanding or compassion from others and this can lead to them not being empathic either. Thatâ€™s why is so important to start listening and understanding the people around us.

> Empathy is such a super-power that we all have but not much of us uses.

Remember that everyone is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. So it's really important to learn how to listen to and understand your own emotions.

Deciding to do something new and to challenge myself I thought about start leaving vscode in favor of using something less resource-eater _(donâ€™t forget that vscode is an electron app)_, and here I am, starting my journy with neo-vim.

Faster than the light, I found myself wandering on some lua-based plugins trying to add them to my setup. This isnâ€™t my first time using neo-vim, but beyond editing simple `.txt` files I donâ€™t have that much experience.

Currently Iâ€™m installing and configuring pluging to setup neo-vim just the way I want to.

Try to always learn something new.

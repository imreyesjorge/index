While browsing the web we encounter words like **URL**, this is a common tech term, but as we go deeper in the tech field, there's another terms that shows up, that's **URI** and the least common **URN**.

## What the fork are these terms?

The first thing to understand is the wider term, the **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**. It does what it says, it's just the identifier of a resource in the internet like a _hyper-text document_, a _file_, an _image_, or anything that can be stored.

> Think about the URI as group term, it can refer to an URN or a URL.

### The Uniform Resource Name (URN)

This is a formal way of naming a resource, ensuring that this resource name is unique. It's made by following a predefined [scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes).

> For example, we can use the [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) scheme as: `urn:isbn:0451450523`

### The Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

Imagine we want to access the contents of an specific resource, say a book (`.pdf` for example), we will need not only need the information about this resource location, we also need information about _how_ we can access it, that's when the **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** comes at hand, because it appends a prefix about _how_ we can access this resource.

Using a **protocol** before the resource location gives to us the URL.

> For example, we can use the Hashnode address: `https://hashnode.com`

## Conclusion

All the **URNs** and **URLs** are **URIs**, and while the URN only identifies resources without telling you how to access them, the URL do tell you where and how to access the desired resource.
